PuMuKIT2 Youtube Bundle
=======================

Bundle based on [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) to work with the [PuMuKIT2 Video Platform](https://github.com/campusdomar/PuMuKIT2/blob/2.1.x/README.md).

This bundle allows to upload and publish videos from PuMuKIT2 into a YouTube channel.

This bundle needs to synchronize Youtube with PuMuKIT 2.1. This synchronization can be done manually from the command line or configurating the Cron tool to do it automatically according to a timeschedule. You can find more information on this in the Configuration guide.
